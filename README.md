🎄 Advent of Code Solutions 2025 Edition
This repository contains my solutions for a 12-day coding challenge. Each folder (Day_1, Day_2, etc.) holds the code for a specific day's problem.

🚀 How to Run
To execute the solution for any given day, navigate to the main directory (ADVENT_OF_CODE_...) and simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd Day_1  # or whichever day you want
dotnet run
```

This will run the project's Program.cs file, which is currently configured to read the actual.txt input for the first day.

📁 Input Files
Each day's folder includes an input subdirectory:

test.txt: This file contains the sample input provided by the challenge creators. Use this to test and verify your solution against known examples.

actual.txt: This file contains the real, larger input required to get the final answer for the day's challenge.
